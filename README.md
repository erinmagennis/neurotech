Problem: Neuromarkers of health are primarily discussed with scientific lab jargon and are buried deep within scientific journals. They are not understandable, accessible, relatable, or meaningful to non-scientists wanting to engage with the information to improve their lives. This results in important information and discoveries not having the impact it could have on end-users’ wellbeing. 

Solution: Take an end-user approach first and understand the end user’s perspective, understand how they prefer to engage with health neuromarker information, and be invited into building solutions designed for them. 

Plan: 

Aim 1: Gather partner participants for end-user testing. Ideal partner participants are people who have a specific neurologically related condition (migraines, autonomic dysfunction, ADHD, etc) who are likely more driven to be in tune with and interested in their health neuromarkers.
- Identify support groups, research labs, and healthcare providers that serve these populations. 
- Build collaborations and partnerships with these groups. 
- Onboard end users/people with the given conditions to feedback sessions for the following aims. 

Aim 2: Work with these end-users to identify their current understanding of health neuromarkers. 
- Identify the level of understanding end-users have of key health neuromarkers. 
- Identify when end-users are most interested in engaging with information about their health neuromarkers.
- Identify what neuromarkers or neuromarker affects they care about. 

Aim 3: Identify end-users’ preferred forms of engagement with neuromarker information. 
- Identify what end-user personas exist and how this affects solution design. 
- Collaborate with UI/UX, branding, and education expertise to make engaging content, mockups, and experiences on health neuromarkers that users will enjoy interacting with and do end-user testing to receive their feedback on these solutions. 
- Provide opportunity for end-users to design solutions. 

Aim 4: Build cross-discipline communities (or community platform) where lab researchers, end-users, and startup/tech platform builders can collaborate together to build better solutions. 
- Create standards of engagement where all parties have a stake and are fairly involved. 
- Invite each of these people (lab researchers, end-users, and startup/tech platform builders) to a place (forum, app, group chat, contact list) where they can connect together and share ideas, knowledge, and feedback. 
- Host events and opportunities to further facilitate connections across backgrounds. 

Future directions: After the following aims are completed different user personas and early-stage scalable systems can be identified and expanded to other populations (other conditions, other demographics, general population, etc)
